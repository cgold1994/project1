<!-- Challenges :
  
I had trouble getting the timer to actually stop at 0 instead of going into the negatives.

Hinder the amount of hints allowed but abandoned the idea.

I was unable to make an alert if the users guess was wrong/right.

I wanted to declare a winner or loser at the end of time but had trouble.

Also wanted to add gifs for winner celebration/loser page.


Overall, I had alot of trouble and roadbumps working on this project. Javascript is still my biggest struggle and knowing how and where to create the functions. I would like to scrap this idea and try another way to do an unscramble game in the future. -->




Triumphs :

Although I had trouble stopping it at 0, adding a proper timer was a triumph. I referenced stopInterval lesson and project0

I was able to display the value from the input field onto the screen

Adding the input attributes and seeing them work was a triumph.However, I learned that autocapitalize works on virtual keyboards instead of physical keyboards.

Although I'm not 100% satisfied with the final product , I did enjoy changing the CSS around. Including button animations, font styling and making a "highway sign" from the properties.
