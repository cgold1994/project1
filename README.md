Title :Spelling Ave (subject to change) NY slang focus

Summary :I used to like playing a spelling game named wordscapes on the train going to work.I would fill out a crossword puzzle by unscrambling different words. With that inspiration , I'd like to keep my game simple and have the user just unscramble words at different levels. 

Game Rules/User Story: 
       -1 player game

       -There will be 3 levels : easy, medium, hard  (bonus)

       -The player scores by unscrambling the first word and moving onto the next level.

       -A winner will be declared by passing all levels at the end of the game. 

       -The user gets 4 hints for the entire game. 

       -If player is unable to spell the words correctly then they will be declared a loser.
